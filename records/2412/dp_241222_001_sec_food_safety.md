# Key Points

## Regulatory Issues
- US allows food companies to self-regulate chemical additives
- FDA lacks capability for thorough third-party review
- Europe requires proof of chemical safety before approval

## Specific Cases
1. Chick-fil-A
   - Nearly 100 ingredients in chicken sandwich
   - Company made changes after Food Babe investigation

2. Kraft Mac & Cheese
   - Removed artificial dyes in US
   - Already dye-free in Europe due to warning label requirements

3. Subway

   - Chemical also found in yoga mats and shoe rubber
   - Becomes carcinogenic when heated

## Health Implications

## Solutions
