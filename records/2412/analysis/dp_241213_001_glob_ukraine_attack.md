# Summary
Russia has conducted one of its largest aerial attacks of the year on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, launching nearly 300 combined missiles and drones. The attack comes as temperatures drop significantly for the first time this winter, targeting critical energy facilities across multiple regions.

## Key Details
- Total projectiles: 93 missiles and approximately 200 drones
- Target: Primary focus on energy infrastructure
- Scale: One of the largest attacks of 2024
- Location: Multiple regions affected, with western Ukraine experiencing significant impact
- Timing: Coordinated with first severe temperature drop of winter

## Impact Assessment
- Power outages reported across western and central Ukraine
- Kiev's defense systems reportedly performed well, with limited damage to the capital
- Additional strain on existing scheduled power cuts
- Strategic timing coinciding with winter temperature drop
- Residential areas affected, including strikes in eastern regions

## Strategic Analysis
1. Timing Considerations:
   - Attack synchronized with seasonal temperature decrease
   - Part of broader pattern targeting civilian infrastructure
   - 12th major energy system attack of the current campaign

2. Tactical Approach:
   - Combined use of missiles and drones
   - Wide geographic distribution of targets
   - Focus on western infrastructure suggests possible attempt to disrupt supply lines

3. Defensive Response:
   - Ukrainian authorities maintaining operational security by limiting damage reports
   - Enhanced protection observed around Kiev
